## 🚀 **Getting Started**

### Prerequisites

Before running this project, ensure you have the following:

- **Node.js** installed on your machine.
- **MongoDB Atlas**: Create a free-tier cluster and obtain the connection string.
- **SSL Certificates**: Create SSL keys (`privatekey.pem`, `certificate.pem`) for secure HTTPS communication.

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/APDS-Test-1.git
   cd APDS-Test-1
   ```

2. **Setup Backend:**

   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables:**

   Create a `.env` file in the `backend` folder with the following content:

   ```
   MONGO_URI="Your MongoDB URI"
   JWT_SECRET="Your JWT Secret Key"
   PORT=3001
   ```

4. **Start the Backend Server:**

   ```bash
   node server.mjs
   ```

5. **Setup Frontend:**

   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   ```

6. **Run the React Frontend:**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

7. **Access the Application:**

   - Visit `https://localhost:3001` for the Backend API.
   - Visit `https://localhost:3000` for the React Frontend.
